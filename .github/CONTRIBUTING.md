# Contributing to Orion

***Note:** This document extends and **overrides** the [GSRI Standard Contribution Guide](https://github.com/team-gsri/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).*

## Specific code writing instructions

There are two ways of contributing to this repository source code :
* Contribute to the mission engine (called DW) by adding features or fixing bugs
* Improve the gameplay by adding or modifying missions

### Contributing to the DW engine

The engine mainly depends on files located in the [`functions/` driectory](../CONT_Orion.Malden/functions/).

### Contributing to the mission set

Adding new missions is easy in the DW engine. All missions are stored in the [`missions/`](../CONT_Orion.Malden/missions). A given mission is represented by a folder containing all relevants elements for the mission to run properly. In order to be taken into account, a mission must be associated with proper metadata in [`DwMissions.hpp`](../CONT_Orion.Malden/DwMissions.hpp).
